Numeric_Methods
===============

A collection of Matlab Functions for numeric analysis

### Summary

This set contains a list of numeric functions for MatLab. Most if not all of these methods were derived from the methods and algorithms given in "Applied Numerical Analysis: Second Edition" by Curtis F. Gerald

### Function Detail
#### Nonlinear Equations

##### Halving
The halving or bisection method divides a suggested intereval by 2, then checks if the function value at that point is more or less than the desired value then resets the intereval accordingly. It is about as glacially slow as possible.

##### Secant
